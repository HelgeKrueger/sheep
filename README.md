As a fan of `#sheepsofmastodon`, I have decided to name this ActivityPub client sheep. The code is in early alpha stage.

### Usage

```
python sheep.py DOMAIN USERNAME
```

Example

```
python sheep.py mas.to helgek@mas.to --verbose
```

### Features

- Fetch webfinger
- Fetch actor
- Fetch outbox
- Allow one to view first page of outbox and display its objects
